# Project Name: MOVIE DATABASE 


## Project Description
A reactjs application that gives the user access to movies and tv shows fetched using API from themdb.com. My inspiration was trying to create a netflix clone.


## Dependencies

    npm i axios
    npm i styled-components
    npm i framer-motion

The project runs from an API provided by https://themoviedb.org

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
