# Project Name: MOVIES DATABASE 


## Project Description
A reactjs application that gives the user access to movies and tv shows fetched using API from themdb.com. My inspiration was trying to create a netflix clone.


## Dependencies
    npm i react-router-dom
    npm i axios
    npm i styled-components
    npm i framer-motion

## Setup Instructions
The project runs from an API provided by https://themoviedb.org

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### BDD

### Input
The application does not have an input

### Output
The movies displayed from API are grouped into different categoried. Clicking on any movie card gives you access to more details about the movie.
